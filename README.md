# RPG Utils

https://maxwilson.github.io/ShiningSword/

Player utilities for AD&D.

## Quick-start

```bash
npm i
npm start
start http://localhost:8080
```

## Requirements

* [dotnet SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) v7.0 or higher
* [node.js](https://nodejs.org) v18+ LTS


## Editor

To write and edit your code, you can use either VS Code + [Ionide](http://ionide.io/), Emacs with [fsharp-mode](https://github.com/fsharp/emacs-fsharp-mode), [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/) or Visual Studio.


## Deployment

To build the application and make ready for production:
```
npm run build
```
This command builds the application and puts the generated files into the `dist` directory (can be overwritten in vite.config.js). This is done automatically on github after checkin.
