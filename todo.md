For a battle, we have several phases:

Populate (from stat blocks or CharSheets)
Declare actions
Execute actions
Apply effects
Show results
Apply ad-hoc effects
Export to CharSheets

Known bugs/feature gaps:

* Trademark Move should have constraints to make you specify maneuver and (for each attack) weapon, hit location, and whether you're using Deceptive Strike, Dual-Weapon Attack, or Rapid Strike. Or maybe it should just specify an attack routine by name.

* Signature Gear and Weapon Bond should be tied to gear in some specific way, maybe by a GUID.
